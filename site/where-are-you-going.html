      <p>“<span lang="es">¿Dónde vas, buen caballero?</span>” (which also has the variation “<span lang="es">¿Dónde vas, Alfonso XII?</span>”) is one of my favorite ballads, and like every ballad, there are many versions of the lyrics and melody. This meant that when I began to translate the song to Spanish, the first question was, which song? In the end, I did what every ballad singer does: combine different versions to highlight the grief that for me is the heart of the ballad.</p>
      <p>One challenge I encountered while translating was that the different versions, which had different melodies, didn't all have the same meter. In particular, one performance by Joaquín Díaz used a melody I haven’t heard elsewhere, which enabled me to make some translation choices I prefer on a lyrical level, but which don’t work with the more common meter and melody. My ultimate solution? Write two versions. It’s a folk song; I can do that!</p>
      <p>Both of my translations are presented below, with recordings that fit the meter. For more information on the sources I used, see <a href="/donde-vas.html" title="Radio Calendula: ¿Dónde vas, buen caballero?">here</a> (in Spanish).</p>
      <h2>Version 1</h2>
      <div class="verse block-center">
        <p>
          <span>—Oh, where are you going, soldier?</span>
          <span>Sir, what is your errand here?</span>
          <span>—I go in search of my lady,</span>
          <span>who I have not seen in years.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>—Your lady is dead and buried;</span>
          <span>I saw her laid in the ground.</span>
          <span>—Whether she be dead or living,</span>
          <span>I'd know where she can be found.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Upon coming to her gravesite,</span>
          <span>a black shadow I did see.</span>
          <span>The more I retreated from it,</span>
          <span>the more it drew close to me.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>—Oh, don't you be frightened, soldier,</span>
          <span>no, don't you be scared of me.</span>
          <span>I am your wife you love dearly</span>
          <span>and I've come to take my leave.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>—If you're my wife I love dearly,</span>
          <span>then grant me one last embrace.</span>
          <span>—The arms I would use to hold you,</span>
          <span>The earth has taken away.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>—If you're my wife I love dearly,</span>
          <span>then grant me a kiss, at least.</span>
          <span>—The lips I would use to kiss you</span>
          <span>the worms have taken from me.</span>
